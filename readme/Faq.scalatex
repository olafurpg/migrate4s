@sect{FAQ / Troubleshooting}

  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask on gitter @gitter.

  @sect{Enclosing tree [2873] does not include tree [2872]}
    Scalafix requires code to compile with the scalac option @code{-Yrangepos}.
    A macro that emits invalid tree positions is usually the cause of
    compiler errors triggered by @code{-Yrangepos}.
    Other tools like the presentation compiler (ENSIME) or
    Scalameta Semantic API also require @code{-Yrangepos} to work properly.

  @sect{sbt.Init$RuntimeUndefined: References to undefined settings at runtime.}
    You might be using an old version of sbt.
    sbt-scalafix requires sbt 0.13.13 or higher.

  @sect{Scalafix doesn't do anything}
    It could be that sbt-scalafix failed to enable the @sect.ref{Scalahost} compiler plugin.
    Scalafix does not work with Scala 2.10.
    You can check if Scalahost is enabled in sbt with @code{show myproject/scalacOptions}.
    If it does not contains an option @code{-Xplugin:/path/to/scalahost.jar},
    then Scalahost is not enabled.
    See @lnk("here", "http://scalameta.org/tutorial/#Installation")
    for how to manually install scalahost and verify that
    @code{.semanticdb} files are created.

  @sect{RemoveUnusedImports does not remove unused imports}
    Make sure that you followed the instructions in @sect.ref{RemoveUnusedImports}
    regarding scalac options.
