# Rules

Scalafix comes with a few rules out-of-the-box.
These rules have been chosen to meet the long-term goal of scalafix to
[clarify the Scala to Dotty migration path](http://scala-lang.org/blog/2016/05/30/scala-center-advisory-board.html#the-first-meeting).
To create custom rules, see @sect.ref{scalafix-core}.
